A warm welcome to my webpage.

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Institute for Financial Management and Research, Sri City](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fkrea.edu.in%2Fifmrgsb%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHohHx0KPRugyn-z-4LFd0VargKZw).

I received my PhD in Development Studies, and M.Sc. in Economics from [Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.igidr.ac.in%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFyYPfWDhIi6kTm0XovadOMFKpm3Q), Mumbai.  I hold a B.A. in Economics, Geography, and English Literature from the [University of Allahabad](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.allduniv.ac.in%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHHEKSzRZ-qJFERul2pH3glhnqo4Q), Allahabad.

My thesis looked into the issue of regional imbalances in Maharashtra. I show that the constitutional mandate in form of the Article 371(2) did not ameliorate regional differences in the state.

My current research examines three aspects of Indian development story:

-  The relationship between caste diversity and access to public goods in villages.
-  Segregation in Indian cities.
- The movement from farm to non-farm occupations (_structural transformation_).
